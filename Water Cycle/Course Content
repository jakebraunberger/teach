An itinerary of sorts.

> Water Cycle
	> Background
		> What is matter?
		> Google earth demo?

		> Microscopes.
			> What would happen if we continued to zoom in?
		> Atoms stick together to make up matter.

		> Temperature.
			> Hot atoms move fast.
				> What is the fastest something can move?
			> Cold atoms move slow.
				> What is the slowest something can move?
			> But they always try to stick together.

		> Melting point and boiling point.
		> Ice, water, water vapor.
			> Start with ice, move up in temperature.
			> Start with vapor, move down in temperature.
		> Liquid nitrogen, nitrogen.
		> Cream, ice cream.
			> Pedagogical value: functions as both example and 
				model. Save model aspect for later.


> Then continue to physical science
