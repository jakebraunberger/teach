PHYSICAL SCIENCE
`````````````````````````````
> Where are we heading? Always keep this in mind.
	> We are going towards just an introduction to science and
		to what the course is going to be like. Concrete example of
		a model.
	> May go into some detail on how a lens works.
		> May be borderline schizophrenic if I go into too much
			detail. Too much jumping around to keep track of what 
			is going on for most.
