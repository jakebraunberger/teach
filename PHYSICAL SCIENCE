9th Science Standards
````````````````````
Details
	9-10.3.7. Use Newton’s Laws to describe the motion of an object

	9-10.3.8. Describe the relationships between kinetic and potential energy in basic transformations (e.g., physical and chemical changes) 

	9-10.3.9. Compare and contrast electromagnetic and mechanical waves (i.e. energy, energy transfer, medium)

	9-10.3.10. Describe the differences between series and parallel circuits

	9-10.3.4. Construct a model of an atom (e.g., protons, neutrons, electrons, nucleus, electron cloud)

General Ideas
	9-10.1.1. Explain how models can be used to illustrate scientific principles

	9-10.1.3. Explain how a system can be dynamic yet may remain in equilibrium (e.g., water cycle, rock cycle, population)

	9-10.1.4. Describe the relationship between form and function (e.g., solids, liquids, gases, cell specialization, simple machines, and plate tectonics)

	9-10.1.5. Explain how classification can be based on the relationship between form and function (e.g., elements and compounds, biological classifications, types of clouds)

	9-10.1.6. Identify principles governing evolution and equilibrium within systems (e.g., cause and effect, positive and negative feedback)

	9-10.2.1. Explain how scientific investigations can result in new ideas

	9-10.2.3. Identify questions and concepts that guide scientific investigations

	9-10.2.4. Formulate a testable hypothesis for a simple investigation 

	9-10.2.5. Identify the independent and dependent variables, the control, and the constants when conducting an experiment 

	9-10.2.8. Analyze data found in tables, charts, and graphs to formulate conclusions

	8.2.1. Explain how science advances through legitimate skepticism

	8.2.3. Use basic mathematics and statistics (e.g., operations, mean, median, mode, range, and estimation) to interpret quantitative data


5th Science Standards
`````````````````````
5.2.1. Communicate scientific procedures (e.g. visual display, graph, journal, oral presentation) that enable others to repeat the investigation

5.2.2. Formulate an explanation supported by data

6.1.1. Construct a model to represent concepts, features, or phenomena in the real world (e.g., solar system, earth’s interior)

6.1.2. Identify systems that are composed of subsystems (e.g., solar system, cell, ecosystems.) 

6.1.3. Explain the connection between cause and effect in a system

5.1.3. Identify details of an object’s form which determine its function (e.g., webbed feet for use in water, human feet for walking, shovel for scooping dirt, a rake for collecting leaves, tape measure and ruler to measure distance)


6th Science Standards
`````````````````````
6.2.1. Explain the components of a scientific investigation (e.g., hypothesis, observation, data collection, data interpretation, communication of results, replicable)

6.2.3. Identify biases that may affect data collection and analysis (e.g., gender, race, religion, economic, generational.)

6.2.4. Use appropriate tools and techniques to gather and analyze data

6.2.5. Use data from scientific investigations to determine relationships and patterns

6.1.1. Construct a model to represent concepts, features, or phenomena in the real world (e.g., solar system, earth’s interior)

6.1.2. Identify systems that are composed of subsystems (e.g., solar system, cell, ecosystems.) 

6.1.3. Explain the connection between cause and effect in a system

5.1.3. Identify details of an object’s form which determine its function (e.g., webbed feet for use in water, human feet for walking, shovel for scooping dirt, a rake for collecting leaves, tape measure and ruler to measure distance)
