PRIORITIZE
````````````

Get organized... T-7 (useful) days......
`````````````````````````````````````````
(1) 5th & 6th & 9th Science
	(b) Physics
		(i) Sketch out logistics Thursday.
		(ii) Today just determine whether or not you'll be hitting the
			 science standards for 5th, 6th, 9th graders in north dakota.
		(iii) Find Mr. Gary's notes from Kaine -- gotta be at grandma's

(2) 7th Life Science
	(a) Need to start some lesson plans.. should be fine here
		(b) Do at least one by end of day Thursday

(4) Geometry
	(a) A lesson plan by end of day Friday.

(5) Homework for MAT class (and get in touch with Dr. McCoy and superconductors from DSU)

Today
`````````````````````````
> Start w/ straightforward classes. Lesson plans for the simple ones.
> Then physical science. (Will take more time.)
> Time budget approximation.
	> Homework Prep and Grading
		> HW 2x / wk. for life science.
			> ~ 4 hrs. to grade
			> ~ 4 hrs. to prepare
		> HW for geometry every day / every other day
			> ~ 2 hrs. / night
		> 9th Physical science
			> ~ 4 hrs. to grade
			> ~ 4 hrs. to prepare
	> Prep for Class
		> 1 hr. per class minimum per night (~ 3 hrs. / night)
		> All Saturday and Sunday, prep for the following wk.
	> Assume 80 hrs. in a week (one year of hell...again...)
		> Net hrs. for class:
			> 8 * 2 + (2 + 3) * 5 	= 41 hrs.
			> School 				= 40 hrs.
			> Less (2 + 1) * 5 		= 15 hrs. 		(Off period and 5th science only 3x per week.)
			>   `````````````````````````````````
			> 						= 66 hrs.
			
> Conclusion:
	> I suck at time budgets. And basic math.
